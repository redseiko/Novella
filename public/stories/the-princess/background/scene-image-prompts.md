**Art Style Instructions:**

Generate a digital painting in a dark, atmospheric manhwa/anime style. The art should have the emotional depth and rich, painterly textures of a high-quality webtoon, combined with the dramatic, cinematic compositions of an anime film. The overall mood is ethereal, dreamlike, unsettling, and melancholic, blending dark fantasy and psychological horror.

Use clean, expressive linework for key details, but soften it with atmospheric lighting and painterly rendering to avoid a simplistic or "flat" look. Avoid photorealism and standard "moe" anime styles.

The color palette must be desaturated and stylized, dominated by cool tones: bruised purples, deep indigos, cold greys, and earthy browns. Use accent colors sparingly for high emotional impact. The lighting should be dramatic and cinematic, using strong chiaroscuro with deep, graphically defined shadows and soft, blooming light sources to create a sense of isolation and mystery.

Subtly incorporate digital/glitch elements to hint that the world is an unstable construct. This can include faint chromatic aberration at the edges, soft scanlines in shadows, or textures that evoke corrupted data, integrated seamlessly into the painterly style.

## Background Prompts by Key

### Key: `forest-path-initial`
**Used in Scenes:** `start`, `explore-path`, `start-no-locket`, `start-with-locket`

**Prompt:**
A wide, cinematic shot in a dark manhwa style. A desolate, lonely path cuts through a skeletal forest under a bruised, twilight sky. The trees are rendered with sharp, gnarled linework, their branches like claws. The path is unnaturally straight, leading towards a small, hunched cabin barely visible in the distant, atmospheric gloom. The mood is cold, oppressive, and profoundly melancholic, with a desaturated color palette of cold blues and deep indigos.

### Key: `forest-path-hesitation`
**Used in Scenes:** `ask-about-vision`, `hesitate`, `explore-narrator-self`, `explore-narrator-creator`, `explore-narrator-unwrite`

**Prompt:**
A claustrophobic, oppressive shot in a dark manhwa style. The perspective is tighter on the path, with the skeletal trees looming over it like silent, judgmental figures. Their dark, textured forms press in from the sides of the frame, creating a sense of being watched and trapped. The lighting is dimmer than before, with the path ahead fading into a deeper, more uncertain shadow. This scene should visually represent the character's internal conflict and rising dread.

### Key: `forest-path-prison`
**Used in Scene:** `forced-return`

**Prompt:**
A sterile, unsettling shot in a dark manhwa style. The character has been forced back to the path. The path is now unnaturally clean and perfect, the dirt packed down with an impossible smoothness. The skeletal trees stand in rigid, repeating lines, like the bars of a cage. The atmosphere is one of defeat and control; the world feels less like a real place and more like a perfectly rendered, inescapable digital prison. The lighting is flat and even, erasing all comforting shadows.

### Key: `vision-glade`
**Used in Scene:** `examine-locket`

**Prompt:**
A beautiful, ethereal scene in a painterly manhwa style, depicted as a fleeting, overexposed memory. A sun-drenched glade is bathed in a warm, golden, blooming light that makes the edges hazy. The linework is soft and minimal. Lush green grass and wildflowers are rendered with soft, impressionistic brushstrokes. The atmosphere is serene and nostalgic, yet tinged with the sadness of a forgotten dream. A subtle lens flare or chromatic aberration hints that this memory is a glitch, a beautiful error.

### Key: `thorn-path`
**Used in Scene:** `walk-away`

**Prompt:**
A nightmarish, graphic scene in a dark manhwa style. An impassable wall of thorns blocks the path. The thorns are rendered with sharp, aggressive linework, unnaturally large and twisted. A thick, black ichor glistens with sharp highlights as it drips from the barbs. The lighting is harsh, coming from an unseen source that casts dramatic, terrifying shadows, creating a stark black-and-white composition with accents of deep, sickly purple.

### Key: `shattered-woods`
**Used in Scenes:** `shattered-woods-entry`, `meet-the-echo`, `echo-explains`

**Prompt:**
A chaotic, surreal digital painting in a glitchy manhwa style. A fragmented forest where reality is broken. Trees are frozen mid-fall, rendered with sharp linework that fractures into geometric shards. The ground is a jarring mosaic of textures: a patch of ancient cobblestone, a square of barren desert sand, a piece of star-dusted void. The scene is filled with digital artifacts like pixel sorting and datamoshing, but integrated into the painterly webtoon aesthetic. The lighting is inconsistent and chaotic.

### Key: `cabin-exterior`
**Used in Scenes:** `cabin-approach`, `explore-cabin-exterior`, `call-out`

**Prompt:**
A cinematic shot of an ancient, weathered cabin in a gloomy forest, in a dark manhwa style. The cabin's wood is warped and grey, drawn with detailed, textured linework. The focus is the single door, slightly ajar, spilling a thin sliver of impossibly warm, sorrowful light into the gloom. The composition should create a sense of foreboding and melancholic invitation, contrasting the cold, desaturated world outside with the single sliver of warm light.

### Key: `cabin-interior-first-encounter`
**Used in Scene:** `cabin-enter`

**Prompt:**
The sparse, minimalist interior of a rustic cabin, in an atmospheric manhwa style. The Princess stands with her back to the viewer, gazing out a single, large window at a forest that isn't there. A dramatic shaft of light from the window silhouettes her figure, casting long shadows across the meticulously clean room. The atmosphere is one of eerie stillness and quiet anticipation.

### Key: `cabin-interior-locket-reveal`
**Used in Scene:** `show-locket-scene`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, the Princess has turned towards the viewer, her calm composure finally broken. Her weary grey eyes are wide with a raw, vulnerable emotion as she looks at the locket being held out to her. The lighting in the room is soft, focusing on her shocked and trembling expression. The atmosphere is tense and emotionally charged.

### Key: `cabin-interior-riddles`
**Used in Scenes:** `explore-who-are-you`, `explore-vessel`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, the Princess has turned slightly, but her face remains partially obscured in dramatic shadow. She speaks cryptically, her expression unreadable and distant. The light from the window carves out the shape of her form, but leaves her features a mystery. The mood is enigmatic and unsettling, emphasizing her role as a keeper of secrets.

### Key: `cabin-interior-empty`
**Used in Scene:** `explore-room`

**Prompt:**
A shot of the sparse, minimalist interior of a rustic cabin, in a clean, atmospheric manhwa style. The Princess is not the focus. The frame captures a simple cot, a cold hearth, and a single wooden chair, all rendered with clear, simple linework. The light from a single, unseen window cuts across the room, illuminating floating dust motes and casting long, dramatic shadows. This isn't a home; it's a stage, a room for waiting, not for living.

### Key: `cabin-interior-confrontation`
**Used in Scene:** `talk-to-princess`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, the Princess has turned to fully face the viewer. The camera angle is straight on. Her expression is not one of fear, but of profound, ancient weariness and intelligence. The cinematic light from the window illuminates her pale face and sad grey eyes, creating a direct and intimate confrontation. The atmosphere is one of solemn truth.

### Key: `cabin-interior-truth`
**Used in Scenes:** `princess-explains`, `narrator-interjects`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, the Princess takes a small step forward, her expression shifting from resignation to an earnest, quiet plea. The light catches a glimmer of hope or desperation in her weary eyes as she explains the truth of her situation. The scene is intimate and emotional, with the focus entirely on her sincere, expressive face.

### Key: `cabin-interior-revelation`
**Used in Scenes:** `princess-locket-reaction`, `narrator-defeat`

**Prompt:**
The interior of the rustic cabin, but the atmosphere has shifted dramatically. A single, powerful ray of light now cuts through the gloom, as if the sun has broken through the clouds for the first time. The light illuminates the characters, casting out the oppressive shadows. The air feels clear and silent, charged with a newfound sense of hope or clarity. The painterly style should be soft and emotional, emphasizing the quiet, pivotal moment of defiance and connection.

### Key: `cabin-interior-corrupted`
**Used in Scene:** `narrator-struggle`

**Prompt:**
A digital painting of the sparse cabin interior, now warped and unsettling in a glitchy manhwa style. The clean linework of the room is now distorted. The textures of the wooden walls are overlaid with faint, glitchy patterns like digital static. The shadows are unnaturally deep, tinged with a sickly red or purple glow, and the geometry of the room is slightly skewed, creating a disorienting, nightmarish feeling as reality strains.

### Key: `forest-path-corrupted`
**Used in Scene:** `escape-together`

**Prompt:**
A forest path dissolving into a digital nightmare, in a chaotic manhwa style. The path is still visible, but the surrounding trees, rendered with aggressive, frantic linework, are twisting into screaming faces of static. The sky bleeds cascades of glitching code in sickly greens and purples. The world looks like a corrupted webtoon panel, filled with datamoshing, pixelation, and scanlines integrated into the brushwork.

### Key: `void-end`
**Used in Scenes:** `end-direct`, `end-lunge`, `end-betrayal`, `end-locket-betrayal`, `ending-coward`, `thorn-ending`

**Prompt:**
A vast, textured void in a minimalist manhwa style. This is not simple blackness, but a deep, dark space with subtle, painterly variations in tone. Faint, ghostly embers—the last remnants of a forgotten world—drift slowly, their soft glow rendered with delicate brushstrokes. The atmosphere is one ofprofound finality and silence. A visual representation of a fade to black, but with a lingering, melancholic texture.

### Key: `glitched-reality`
**Used in Scene:** `ending-freedom`

**Prompt:**
An abstract, ethereal, and blindingly peaceful white light, in a hopeful manhwa style. This is not empty whiteness, but a textured space suggesting a new reality. Faint, iridescent geometric patterns and soft, shifting colors, like a watercolor painting, can be seen within the overwhelming white. The atmosphere is serene and powerful, a beautiful and cleansing contrast to the previous darkness. The linework is gone, replaced by pure color and light.
