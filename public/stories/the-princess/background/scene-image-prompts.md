## System Instructions & Art Style Definition

**Paste the following as system instructions or at the beginning of every prompt to ensure a consistent visual style across all generated images.**

---

**Art Style Instructions:**

The style of a dark, melancholic Studio Ghibli film. The art should capture the lush, painterly backgrounds and hand-drawn character aesthetic characteristic of Ghibli, but applied to a theme of dark fantasy and psychological mystery. The overall mood is one of quiet wonder, deep melancholy, and unsettling stillness.

Environments should be rich and detailed rendered with soft, painterly brushstrokes. Avoid photorealism and generic "anime" styles.

The color palette must be desaturated and atmospheric. Avoid the bright, cheerful palettes of films like *My Neighbor Totoro*. Instead, focus on the muted, somber tones seen in films like *Princess Mononoke* or the more introspective moments of *Spirited Away*: deep forest greens, earthy browns, cold stone greys, and bruised twilight purples.

Lighting should be cinematic and emotional, using soft, diffused light sources (god rays filtering through a canopy, moody indoor light from a window) and deep, gentle shadows to create a sense of isolation and mystery.

**The Princess:**
A young woman in her late teens.

*   **Physical Appearance:** Slender, with a graceful but weary posture. Her skin is fair and pale, like porcelain. She has long, straight, jet-black hair that falls past her shoulders, with subtle deep blue or indigo undertones visible in the light. Her face is heart-shaped with soft features.
*   **Eyes:** Her most striking feature are her large, expressive eyes, which are a soft, sad, stormy grey. They are intelligent and ancient, holding a profound sense of resignation. She has thin, dark eyebrows and long eyelashes.
*   **Clothing:** She wears a simple, practical, long-sleeved A-line dress that reaches her ankles. The fabric is a worn, high-quality linen, dyed a faded, dusty rose color. It has a high, simple neckline and is unadorned, suggesting a life of asceticism, not royalty. Her feet are bare.

## Background Prompts by Key

### Key: `forest-path-initial`
**Used in Scenes:** `start`, `explore-path`, `start-no-locket`, `start-with-locket`

**Prompt:**
A wide, cinematic digital painting in a dark, melancholic Studio Ghibli style. A lonely, moss-covered dirt path winds through an ancient, quiet forest under a bruised twilight sky. The trees are old and gnarled, their branches reaching out like tired arms, with detailed, painterly bark. The path leads towards a small, hunched cabin barely visible in the distant, atmospheric gloom. The mood is somber and mysterious, with a desaturated color palette of deep greens, earthy browns, and cold greys.

### Key: `forest-path-hesitation`
**Used in Scenes:** `ask-about-vision`, `hesitate`, `explore-world`, `explore-narrator-self`, `explore-narrator-creator`, `explore-narrator-unwrite`

**Prompt:**
A claustrophobic shot in a dark Ghibli style. The perspective is tighter on the forest path, with the ancient, gnarled trees looming over it like silent, judgmental figures. Their dark, painterly forms press in from the sides of the frame, creating a sense of being watched and trapped. The lighting is dimmer, with the path ahead fading into a deeper, more uncertain shadow, rendered with soft, atmospheric brushstrokes.

### Key: `forest-path-prison`
**Used in Scene:** `forced-return`

**Prompt:**
A sterile, unsettling digital painting in a dark Ghibli style. The character has been forced back to the path. The path is now unnaturally clean and perfect, the dirt packed down with an impossible smoothness. The gnarled trees stand in rigid, repeating lines, like the bars of a cage. The atmosphere is one of defeat and control; the world feels less like a real place and more like a perfectly rendered, inescapable prison. The lighting is flat and even, erasing all comforting shadows.

### Key: `forest-path-corrupted`
**Used in Scene:** `escape-together`

**Prompt:**
A forest path dissolving into a digital nightmare, painted in a chaotic Ghibli style. The path is still visible, but the surrounding trees are twisting into screaming faces of static, their painterly textures smearing and pixelating. The sky bleeds cascades of glitching code in sickly greens and purples. The world looks like a corrupted, beautiful painting, filled with datamoshing and scanlines integrated into the brushwork.

### Key: `perfected-path`
**Used in Scenes:** `end-direct`, `end-lunge` (Chapter 2)

**Prompt:**
A digital painting in a serene, but subtly sterile, Ghibli style. The path is brighter now, the trees less menacing, more noble. The sky is a hopeful, overcast grey. The world feels cleaner and more peaceful, but also strangely empty. The painterly details are perfect, almost too perfect, lacking the wildness of a true forest.

### Key: `vision-glade`
**Used in Scene:** `examine-locket`

**Prompt:**
A beautiful, ethereal scene in a painterly Ghibli style, depicted as a fleeting, overexposed memory. A sun-drenched glade is bathed in a warm, golden, blooming light that makes the edges of the frame hazy and dreamlike. Lush green grass and wildflowers are rendered with soft, impressionistic brushstrokes. The atmosphere is serene and nostalgic, yet tinged with the sadness of a forgotten dream. A subtle lens flare hints that this memory is a beautiful error.

### Key: `thorn-path`
**Used in Scenes:** `walk-away`, `thorn-ending` (Chapter 2)

**Prompt:**
A nightmarish, graphic scene in a dark Ghibli style. An impassable wall of thorns blocks the path. The thorns are unnaturally large and twisted, rendered with the sharp detail of ink-wash painting (sumi-e). A thick, black ichor glistens with sharp highlights as it drips from the barbs. The lighting is harsh, coming from an unseen source that casts dramatic, terrifying shadows, creating a stark black-and-white composition with accents of deep, sickly purple.

### Key: `shattered-woods`
**Used in Scenes:** `shattered-woods-entry`, `meet-the-echo`, `echo-explains`

**Prompt:**
A chaotic, surreal digital painting in a glitchy Ghibli style. A fragmented forest where reality is broken. Trees are frozen mid-fall, their painterly forms fracturing into geometric shards. The ground is a jarring mosaic of textures: a patch of ancient mossy stone, a square of barren sand, a piece of star-dusted void. The scene is filled with digital artifacts like pixel sorting and datamoshing, integrated into the painterly aesthetic. The lighting is inconsistent and chaotic.

### Key: `cabin-exterior`
**Used in Scenes:** `cabin-approach`, `explore-cabin-exterior`, `call-out`

**Prompt:**
A cinematic shot of an ancient, weathered cabin in a gloomy forest, in a dark, painterly Ghibli style. The cabin's wood is warped and grey, covered in moss. The focus is the single door, slightly ajar, spilling a thin sliver of impossibly warm, sorrowful light into the gloom. The composition should create a sense of foreboding and melancholic invitation.

### Key: `cabin-interior-first-encounter`
**Used in Scene:** `cabin-enter`

**Prompt:**
The sparse, minimalist interior of a rustic cabin, in an atmospheric Ghibli style. The Princess stands with her back to the viewer, gazing out a single, large window at a forest that isn't there. A dramatic shaft of soft, diffused light from the window silhouettes her figure, illuminating floating dust motes and casting long, gentle shadows across the meticulously clean room. The atmosphere is one of eerie stillness and quiet anticipation.

### Key: `cabin-interior-locket-reveal`
**Used in Scene:** `show-locket-scene`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, painted in a soft, emotional Ghibli style. The Princess has turned towards the viewer, her calm composure finally broken. Her weary grey eyes are wide with a raw, vulnerable emotion as she looks at the locket being held out to her. The lighting in the room is soft, focusing on her shocked and trembling expression. The atmosphere is tense and emotionally charged.

### Key: `cabin-interior-riddles`
**Used in Scenes:** `explore-who-are-you`, `explore-vessel`, `explore-waiting`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, the Princess has turned slightly, but her face remains partially obscured in dramatic, soft-edged shadow. The light from the window carves out the shape of her form, but leaves her features a mystery. The mood is enigmatic and unsettling, emphasizing her role as a keeper of secrets, in a painterly Ghibli style.

### Key: `cabin-interior-empty`
**Used in Scene:** `explore-room`

**Prompt:**
A shot of the sparse, minimalist interior of a rustic cabin, in a clean, atmospheric Ghibli style. The frame captures a simple cot with a neatly folded blanket, a cold stone hearth, and a single wooden chair. The light from a single, unseen window cuts across the room, illuminating floating dust motes and casting long, dramatic shadows. The room feels like a stage for waiting, not a home for living.

### Key: `cabin-interior-confrontation`
**Used in Scene:** `talk-to-princess`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, the Princess has turned to fully face the viewer, in a direct, intimate Ghibli-style portrait. Her expression is not one of fear, but of profound, ancient weariness and intelligence. The cinematic light from the window illuminates her pale face and sad grey eyes, creating a solemn and truthful confrontation.

### Key: `cabin-interior-truth`
**Used in Scenes:** `princess-explains`, `narrator-interjects`

**Prompt:**
Inside the rustic cabin, the Princess takes a small step forward, her expression shifting from resignation to an earnest, quiet plea. The soft Ghibli-style lighting catches a glimmer of desperation in her weary eyes as she explains the truth of her situation. The scene is intimate and emotional, with the focus entirely on her sincere, expressive face.

### Key: `cabin-interior-revelation`
**Used in Scenes:** `princess-locket-reaction`, `narrator-defeat`

**Prompt:**
The interior of the rustic cabin, but the atmosphere has shifted dramatically. A single, powerful ray of soft, warm light now cuts through the gloom, as if the sun has broken through clouds for the first time. The light illuminates the characters, casting out the oppressive shadows. The air feels clear and silent, charged with a newfound sense of hope. The painterly Ghibli style should be soft and emotional.

### Key: `cabin-interior-corrupted`
**Used in Scene:** `narrator-struggle`

**Prompt:**
A digital painting of the sparse cabin interior, now warped and unsettling in a glitchy Ghibli style. The painterly textures of the wooden walls are overlaid with faint, glitchy patterns like digital static. The soft shadows are unnaturally deep, tinged with a sickly red or purple glow, and the geometry of the room is slightly skewed, creating a disorienting, nightmarish feeling as reality strains.

### Key: `tainted-cabin`
**Used in Scenes:** `end-betrayal`, `end-locket-betrayal` (Chapter 2)

**Prompt:**
A digital painting of the cabin's interior in a dark Ghibli style. The scene is the same, but the atmosphere is colder, the shadows deeper and tinged with a subtle, unhealthy color. The warm light from before is gone, replaced by a flat, joyless grey. The room feels hollow and stained by a bad decision.

### Key: `void-end`
**Used in Scenes:** `end-direct`, `end-lunge`, `end-betrayal`, `end-locket-betrayal`, `ending-coward`, `thorn-ending`

**Prompt:**
A vast, textured void in a minimalist painterly style. This is not simple blackness, but a deep, dark space with subtle variations in tone, like a sumi-e ink wash. Faint, ghostly embers—the last remnants of a forgotten world—drift slowly, their soft glow rendered with delicate brushstrokes. The atmosphere is one of profound finality and silence.

### Key: `glitched-reality`
**Used in Scene:** `ending-freedom`

**Prompt:**
An abstract, ethereal, and blindingly peaceful white light, in a hopeful, painterly style. This is not empty whiteness, but a textured space suggesting a new reality. Faint, iridescent geometric patterns and soft, shifting colors, like a watercolor painting, can be seen within the overwhelming white. The atmosphere is serene and powerful, a beautiful and cleansing contrast to the previous darkness.

### Key: `open-fields`
**Used in Scene:** `end-freedom` (Chapter 2)

**Prompt:**
A breathtaking landscape in a classic, hopeful Studio Ghibli style. A vibrant green hill overlooks a vast, sun-drenched field of wildflowers under a brilliant, piercing blue sky with fluffy, hand-painted clouds. A gentle breeze can be seen rustling the grass. The atmosphere is one of immense freedom and new beginnings.

### Key: `deleted-void`
**Used in Scene:** `end-coward` (Chapter 2)

**Prompt:**
A silent, empty digital void. This is a cold, true black, unlike the textured `void-end`. In the oppressive darkness, faint, shimmering, translucent outlines of other forgotten figures can be seen, like glitches or ghosts in the machine. The atmosphere is one of digital purgatory and forgotten data.
